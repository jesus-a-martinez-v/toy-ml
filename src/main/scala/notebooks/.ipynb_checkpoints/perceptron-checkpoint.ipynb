    "# Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no doubt that neural networks are one of the most potent and powerful machine learning algorithms in today's world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will implement the simplest neural networks possible. It consists of only one neuron and it's called __Perceptron__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron works great for two-class classification problems. In order to solve more complex tasks many perceptrons can be combined!\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron algorithm draws inspiration from the way a single cell, called \"neuron\", processes information. Each neuron accepts input data via its dendrites and pass it as a signal to its body. In a similar fashion, a perceptron takes training examples as input signals and combine it in a linear equation called _activation_, that is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ activation = bias + \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(weigth * x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation is then thresholded to output a value or prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ prediction=1.0\\ if\\ activation>=0.0\\ else\\ 0.0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the _weight_ (just another name for _coefficient_) we use __Gradient Descent__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start our implementation by loading the code and libraries we'll need. We will build our solution on top of the ones we implemented in the [previous notebook](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/toy-ml/blob/master/src/main/scala/notebooks/logistic_regression.ipynb)."
