    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important building blocks of machine learning are the evaluation metrics. Why? Well, even though having a computer make predictions on the data we supplied to it is _cool_, not any predictor is useful or even fit for the problem we are trying to solve or tackle using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we tell how __good__ is a certain model? Using math, of course! \n",
    "\n",
    "Enter __evaluation metrics__!\n",
    "\n",
    "An evaluation metrics, roughly speaking, is just a function that takes the prediction our model generates, compare them with the actual labels in the data, and give us a number that indicates how good (or bad) our algorithm is doing. There are many evaluation functions. Some of them are specific to regression and others to classification. Of course, each of them have a set of features that make them stand out at specific circunstances. The ones we are going to explore in this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Accuracy.\n",
    "    - Confusion Matrix.\n",
    "    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",

    "Let's start our implementation by loading the code and libraries we'll need. We will build our solution on top of the ones we implemented in the [previous notebook](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/toy-ml/blob/master/src/main/scala/notebooks/algorithm_evaluation.ipynb)."
